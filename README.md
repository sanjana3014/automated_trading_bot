**Automated_Trading_Bot using Bitmex Rest API**

**Basic Algorithmic Trading Bot for Bitcoin**

As an enthusiast of both cryptocurrencies and coding, I have developed an algorithmic trading bot designed to execute trades on Bitcoin following specified strategies. This project leverages the REST API provided by the Bitmex exchange and draws inspiration from the Bitmex sample market maker bot.

**Key Features:**

**Customizable Strategy:** Users can define and implement trading strategies according to their specific needs, making the bot highly versatile.

**Integrated Trading Environment:** The bot operates within a meticulously crafted environment that includes necessary API files and scripts, ensuring seamless execution of trades.

**Development Platform:** The source code is developed in the Spyder IDE, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.

**Disclaimer:**

The trading logic employed by this bot is intended solely for demonstration purposes and should not be used for actual trading. Users are advised to exercise caution and conduct thorough testing before any real-world application.
